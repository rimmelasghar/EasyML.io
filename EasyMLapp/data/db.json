    "dataPreprocessing":"Data preprocessing is a crucial step in data analysis and machine learning that involves cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw data to make it suitable for analysis or training machine learning models. The quality of the data used in any data-driven task significantly impacts the accuracy and reliability of the results. Data preprocessing aims to enhance the data quality, remove inconsistencies, and eliminate errors so that the data can be effectively used in subsequent data analysis or model building processes.",

    "Linear Regression":"Linear regression is used for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict a continuous output variable. It fits a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable, aiming to minimize the mean squared error between predicted and actual values.",
    "Logistic Regression":"Despite its name, logistic regression is used for binary classification tasks. It predicts the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class, and a threshold is applied to make the final binary classification decision.",
    "Support Vector Machines":"SVM is a powerful classification algorithm that aims to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates the data points of different classes. It is effective for both binary and multiclass classification tasks.",
    "Decision Trees":"Decision trees are tree-like models used for both classification and regression tasks. They make decisions by recursively splitting the data into subsets based on the most significant feature.",
    "Random Forest": "Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.",
    "Gradient Boosting Machines": "GBM is another ensemble learning technique that builds multiple weak learners (usually decision trees) sequentially. It corrects the errors of the previous model, leading to improved predictions.",
    "Naive Bayes": "Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with an assumption of independence between features. It is often used for text classification and spam filtering tasks.",
    "K-Nearest Neighbors": "KNN is a simple classification algorithm that assigns a new data point to the class based on the majority class of its 'k' nearest neighbors in the feature space.",
    "Neural Networks": "Neural networks, especially deep learning models, have gained significant popularity due to their ability to learn complex patterns from data. They are used for various tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.",
    "Linear Discriminant Analysis": "LDA is a dimensionality reduction technique used for classification tasks. It aims to find a linear combination of features that best separates the classes.",
    "Gradient Boosting Trees": "GBT is an enhanced version of gradient boosting that builds decision trees in a stage-wise manner, combining the advantages of both gradient boosting and decision trees.",
    "Unsupervised":"Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on an unlabeled dataset, meaning the input data does not have corresponding output labels. The goal of unsupervised learning is to find patterns, structure, or relationships within the data without explicit guidance on what to look for. The algorithm tries to identify intrinsic patterns in the data by organizing it in a way that reveals meaningful insights."
